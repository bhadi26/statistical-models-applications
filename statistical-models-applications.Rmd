# Discrete Distributions 

## Discrete Uniform Distribution
Models outcomes that have equality probability 
$f(x) = \frac{1}{N}$
$E[X] = \frac{N+1}{2}$
$Var[X] = \frac{(N+1)(N-1)}{12}$
X = 
N = Total Population


## Binomial 
Models the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. 

$P(X=k) = {n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$
$E[X] = np$
$Var[X] = np(1-p)$
X = Number of people who spent more than $100 on a trip
N = Total customer base 
n = Size of the sample 

Key assumptions: 
* Independent observations
* Samples with replacement (if without replacement, N must be sufficiently larger than n)
